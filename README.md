# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

## Description

The GitHub Actions CI/CD setup takes an already functioning application, applies Cypress tests, and ensures the Cypress tests are run everytime a merge request is made from the feature to the develop branch. If it passes all the Cypress tests, it will trigger a Deploy hook for Render to deploy the latest version of the code once a merge request is commited to the main branch.
